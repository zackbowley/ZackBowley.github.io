I have spent the majority of my career working in IT, with three years of varying jobs all focused on the Tech Industry. Starting with my work done in Florida, USA, helping rebuild cable and phone lines in both residential and commercial areas after Hurricane Michael. Worked constructing and routing home security systems, and theaters. Joined the USAF (United States Air Force), having been pushed into the Biomedical Engineering field. While finally joining Suez, my final venture while enduring Data Analytical schooling, exploring analytic equipment as a Technical Engineer while training to become a team lead.<br /><br /><br />
                                </br>I can usually be found in front of my computer either coding, trying to advance my knowledge, or working on my own personal servers.
	When Iâ€™m not sitting behind my computer, I love to be out walking my beautiful dog and exploring the great outdoors. Since I was little my family and I would go Rock Climbing, Backpacking, and Camping till my sister and I were begging to just stay inside for the week.<br /><br />
Becoming a Data Analyst might seem like a big leap coming right out of the Air Force, but to me it was always a perfect fit. Starting young I have always been more mathematically inclined. Not only that, but I was also very organized. Before I knew it was a career I could pursue, I was using analysis tools to sort through popular music on Spotify and comparing it to my own music taste to see the similarities. I would also go through thousands of movies and categorize them just to document the films I liked.<br /><br />
